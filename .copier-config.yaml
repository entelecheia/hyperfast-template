project_description: Hyperfast Template is a self-contained template that helps you
    initialize your project inside the template. It is hyperfast in the sense that
    the template itself is converted into a project in the blink of an eye. It is
    also hyperfast in the sense that it helps you jump start your project with the
    best practices in the dev community.
